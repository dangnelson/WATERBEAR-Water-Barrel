# Additional Barrels

![](svgs/09.svg)

To expand storage capacity you can daisy chain barrels by adding a _Brass Garden Hose Adapter_ on the bottom side of a barrel. Attach the second barrel with an \*8” Linking Hose”. The second barrel is the same design without the downspout hole or overflow needed.

By attaching the barrels at the bottom, as the barrel attached to the gutter fills, it will slowly drain into the other barrel, keeping both full and wet inside. When wooden barrels dry out the boards will begin to separate. If you see this happening during a dry spell, it's best to refill the barrels using whatever water you have. We stick a garden hose in our gutters until the barrels begin to leak excessively when this happens.
