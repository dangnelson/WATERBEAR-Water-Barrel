This design is for watering plants, not for potable drinking storage. It's free of paint and can be built using only battery powered tools.

| | Tools | Supplies | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| First Barrel | 77.45 | 222.33 | 299.78 |
| Second Downspout | | 10.73 | 10.73 |
| Add a Barrel | | 158.84 | 158.84 |

## Plastic Free Goal
Wooden barrels are used rather than the common blue or white plastic drums, the washers are black rubber, and the spigot and overflow are made of brass. The only plastic in use in this design currently is the vinyl hose, which we hope to solve for soon.
